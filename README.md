# Portfolio

## Description

I made this project to showcase my work to those interested in a unique manner. The goal of the webpage was to give potential employers a glimpse into my persona and what work interests me. In addition it was meant to showcase my experience with various coding languages and projects I completed. The project showed me how to reset the style of a webpage so I could add in my own, how to set a background image, create a rudimentary navigtion bar, style containers using flexbox, control the layout of a webpage, and how to adjust the webpage contents to fit different viewports.
