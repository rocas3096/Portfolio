                    <p class="justify">Hello, my name is Oscar Zavala and I am a full stack developer. I started my professional career as an engineering mechanics major at UIUC in 2014 but then transitioned to mechnical engineering after transferring to UIC in the fall of 2017. From there I grdauted with a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering in December of 2019, but didn't really pursue it. I instead choose to try out for professional soccer in Spain from January 2020-August 2021. From there I trainsitioned into a role as ICQA (Inventory Control and Quality Assurance) in Target and then recently transferred to the engineering and facilites department. Recently, I heard about the full-stack development course through Guild and decided to give it a shot to change the direction of my professional career. Coding has been something I dabbled with since my early engineering days but always seemed daunting. I messed with it a bit in Matlab, Ruby in my CS 101 courses, and Python in my senior project but never really committed due to time constraints. I've still got a ways to go but I'm getting better every day.
